# Genergetic


**Short Description**

An outlet device and dashboard to improve energy efficiency with Cloud-powered data, education and cost-reduction. 


**Long Description**

Administration has projected that world energy consumption will grow by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2050. In response, the United States Environmental Protection Agency suggests that using energy more efficiently is one of the fastest, most cost-effective ways to save money, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs, and meet growing energy demand.

Genergetic is an easy and affordable end-to-end device and dashboard to improve energy efficiency with Cloud-powered analytics, education and cost-reduction. It is designed to help homeowners and corporations reduce their carbon footprint while building an intuitive relationship with energy consumption. 

*How Genergetic work?*

Place a Gen-Tab between any device and a power outlet. 
Connect your Gen-Tab to your local Wi-Fi.
Register your Gen-Tab onto the Genergetic Platform. 
Monitor your energy consumption and finances using cloud-powered data. Genergetic will even curate custom trend predictions responding to the time of year, season, rebates, off-peak periods, and more.


Genergetic is supported by a host of IBM technology, smart hardware and web-based applications. An mqtt event is published by the Gen-Tab Smart IOT Hardware, and updated on a regular interval. The event is relayed via the IBM Cloud Foundry Node.js server to the IBM IOT Platform. Genergetic manipulates real-time mqtt requests, storing the data array on IBM Cloudant. This array is then stored onto IBM Cloud Storage, manipulated using IBM Watson Machine Learning, and transmitted to the IBM Cognos Analytics service. The software creates visual dashboards sent via an API call to the front-end IBM Cloud Foundry Web-Application. Here, users directly access curated device cluster dashboards with historical & real-time data updates and improve their device use.


Future iterations of Genergetic include personalized device recommendations, data-powered on-off automation, a unique social component to gamify reducing energy consumption, and integration with third-party devices.
